"""
The metric has to measure how smooth is the latent space. 
Smoothness is loosely defined, but we assume that, given two 
latent points A and B, a model should be:
  - efficient: interpolating from A to B the model has to take 
    the shortest path possible;
  - equality: interpolating from A to B the model should do steps 
    of equal size
We measure efficiency through the fraction between the shortest 
perceptual path A-B and the sum of the interpolation perceptual 
distances between A and B. We measure inequality through the GINI 
coefficient of the interpolation perceptual distances between 
A and B. As we are intesrested in equality, we will use 1-gini.
